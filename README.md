# Welcome to Kotlin Utils!

The inspiration of this package came from interacting with languages such as Python and Kotlin.
Both languages had useful functions to create / initialize lists. However, Python's implementation
requires syntax not compatible with JavaScript, list comprehensions. Therefore, I chose to implementation
some Kotlin functions in JavaScript.

### Functions
* List(items : number, generator : (e : number) => T) : Can be seen as a List constructor, accepts an integer describing the List's length and a generator function that generates each item in the List.
* repeat(times : number, action : () => void) : Repeats action times.

Suggestion for more Kotlin functions are accepted.
